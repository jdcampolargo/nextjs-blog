It’s 11:04 PM on a snowy winter night. It’s dark, lonely, and difficult to walk, so I take the bus.

I always try to greet the bus drivers with a smile and ask them, “How are you?” If they reply and seem like they want to keep going, we continue talking. These drivers have the most interesting stories, from pain and regrets to happiness and gratefulness. 

On this night, I talked to George. We start a conversation about crime around the city and the university area. But we get deeper. He tells me about his background, why he’s driving the bus, and what he wishes he had done differently with his life. 

I listen. He continues.

Sometimes, what all of us want is someone who listens to us, truly listens. 

He told me he went to a community college but partied too much. After the first year, he was no longer going to school. What came after was twenty years of hard work, regrets, and finding the energy to keep living every day. 

George is about to cry. I continue listening. 

What’s been on your mind lately? Anything exciting to you?” I asked. 

I have not been able to stop thinking about his answer ever since. 

George says, “Well man, I drive the bus twelve hours a day, and after I get off, all I want to do is sleep to recover. My kids are six and eight, and they want me to play with them but I physically can’t. I try my best though.”
